- 🚀 I’m currently working on Front-End and Back-End projects.
- 😄 I’m currently learning Javascript, React, Vue, and a little Angular. I always like learning new something everyday.
- 💪 I’m looking to collaborate on Front-End projects but also I'd like to participate in all process for building the projects 😄 and learn new skills and knowledge.
- 🔥 My favorite tools: Notion, Git, VSCode, React and Vue Dev Tools, Google Chrome, Slack, and Discord.
- 🤩 I like listening to music 🎵, playing video games 🎮 (Fifa ⚽ and car racing games 🏎️), watching videos, and sometimes singing my favorite songs(but with lyrics 😂). I love Spotify 💚.
